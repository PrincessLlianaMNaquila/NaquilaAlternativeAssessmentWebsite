            <p>
                In a recent population survey, 7.1 million students under the age of 18 lived in a neighborhood with a poverty rate of 30 percent or more. This high incidence of poverty places these children at a higher rate of becoming ill, not having proper health care, becoming parents before finishing school, using illegal drugs, being exposed to or involved in violence, and going to jail before they are even old enough to vote. These social issues, which will be discussed in this website, can impact a childâ€™s life both outside school as well as inside school.  In education, there is a responsibility to teach them all, but are there things that teachers should know to do this well?  Children living in below-average neighborhoods should be given the same opportunities as children living in average and above-average housing.
